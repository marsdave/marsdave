Hi! I am a former planetary scientist turned data scientist and this is my GitHub for personal side projects. Unfortunately, I do not update it as often as I would like; most of my coding is done at work, where sharing my code is not possible, and my free time has recently been taken up by my daughter. Still, I will try to update this more frequently and share some algorithms and ideas I have been working on.

# About me
In 2019, I obtained my PhD in physics on the topic of spectroscopy for the exploration of Mars. Following my PhD, I joined the science team of the NASA Mars 2020 mission (with the Mars rover Perseverance and the helicopter Ingenuity). After two exciting years of Mars science operations and data analysis of in-situ geochemical measurements, I made the decision to focus my career on the data science aspects of my previous research, as trying out new exciting models and algorithms has always been my favorite part of the job. Now I am working as a data scientist in public administration, where I aim to improve data culture, provide valuable insights to decision makers and broaden my horizon with respect to data analysis and visualizations.
