Hi, my name is David S. Vogt and I'm a planetary scientist and enthusiastic about data science and machine learning. This is my GitHub in which I showcase and maintain some personal projects, which include nice little algorithms that I have written as well as larger projects, all of which are currently written in Python. I might also use this repository for other purposes in the future, we will see.

# About me
I am currently working as a planetary scientist in the German Aerospace Center. In 2019, I obtained my PhD in physics on the topic of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) on Mars. Since then, I have been part of the EU Horizon 2020 project LUVMI-X, in which an international team conceptualized and developed a lightweight lunar rover and its payloads for the investigation of the lunar south pole.

Since 2020, I am a team member of the NASA Mars 2020 mission, which I am very excited about. Specifically, I am a collaborating scientist in the team of the SuperCam instrument on board the Perseverance rover, which is currently traversing the surface of Jezero crater on Mars. SuperCam is a kind of "Swiss army knife" that combines several spectroscopic techniques (laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, Raman and luminescence spectroscopy, visible and infrared spectroscopy), a high-resolution telescopic camera *and* the first-ever microphone on Mars in a single payload. Among other things, I help with the operations of the instrument and I help to analyze the machine learning models that are employed to calculate element concentrations in the investigated samples.

# My foray into data science
As a scientist working in a field with a lot of experimental data and measurements from which information needs to be extracted, I am naturally very interested in finding better ways to analyze my data. As such, I was always drawn to data science and have worked to expand my knowledge on it. For someone working in planetary science, it is already vital to know about statistical data analysis and varios univariate and multivariate regression models (e.g. PLSR, PCR, NNLS, etc.). However, the world of data science has much more to offer than that, some of which is not intrinsically relevant to the natural sciences and so is outside of my main area of expertise. This includes, for example, algorithms developed for time series analysis and forecasting as well as complex neural networks.

# My goals for this repository
My goal here is to start some fun personal projects to get exercise in various fields that are important for my career and that are simply just fun to do for me:
- Programming with Python and learning how to write better code.
- Using GitHub for version control, issue tracking and code sharing.
- Applying different data science models and ideas to various datasets.
- Understanding neural networks and learning to use them to solve problems.

Most of all, I hope that doing these kinds of projects on a regular basis will give me a better intuition on when to apply which kind of model.
